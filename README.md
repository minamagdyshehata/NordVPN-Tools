# NordVPN-Tools
I recently got a 3 years plan for NordVPN and I really recommend it for everyone.
For some devices that don't support VPN I had to setup a Secured Virtual Wifi to share it with those devices.
I created three python scripts that can make this very easy for everyone.

First Script: SetupNordVPNSecuredWifi.py, is to setup the Virtual Wifi.

Second Script: NordVPNSecuredWifiOnOff.py, is to easily turn the virtaul Wifi On and Off.

Third Script: VirtualAdapterRemover.py, is to remove the virtual Wifi (in case you need to remove it).

I also made EXE version of the three scripts just to make it easy for everyone to use them.
When I wrote those scripts I was focused on NordVPN but those tools are universal and can be used to setup a virtual Wifi, turn it On/Off or remove it.
Here are the download links for the EXE version of the three scripts :
